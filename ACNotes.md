- calc cooling load from sensible heat + latent heat on an hourly (?) timeframe
- convert cooling load (in Watts) to electrical power from ac efficiency
- sum power over time to get energy in kWh
- use utility info to convert kWh into pollution impact

## useful terms

- airHeatCapacity (J _ kg<sup>-1</sup> _ K<sup>-1</sup>)
- buildingVolume (m<sup>3</sup>)
- airChangesPerHour
- coefficientOfPerformance = cooling delivered (W)/eletrical input (W)
- 1 kWh = 3.6Ã—10^6 J
