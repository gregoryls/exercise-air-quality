- cigarette particulate matter is almost always below 1 micron, well within the 2.5 micron boundary
- total particulate matter in one cigarette is 15.5-41.5mg
- minute volume may range from 10 L/min at rest, 25-40 light exercise, 65 medium, 100 hard (all the way up to 180:130 male:female max)...needs more research.
- minute volume (MV) can be estimated from heartrate (HR) MV=exp(1.16 + 0.021\*HR) which is within error of experimental data
