- Women have approximately 75% of the potential minute volume compared to men due mostly to lung size.

- since user is unlikely to know respiration rate on top of lung volume use custom volume to adjust calculated minute ventilation in the same way male/female is calculated---simply adjust by ratio. Standard male lung volume 6.0L
